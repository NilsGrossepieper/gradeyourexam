**gradeyourexam.com** was a university course project that enabled teachers to create, upload, and grade exams automatically using AI-powered evaluation methods.  
The project required hosting a large model (*Llama 3 8B*), which made long-term deployment costly.  
As a result, the live site is no longer running, but the repository and documentation remain for reference.
